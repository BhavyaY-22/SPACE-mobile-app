# SPACE-mobile-app
> This is a space themed social media platform app for budding entrepreneurs to interact with consumers and investors.
> This was developed using react native and firebase db.
> The app has 3 different interfaces based on the type of registration of the account, i.e., entrepreneur, consumer or investor.
> As an entrepreneur account holder you can:
  - Look through the problem statements posted by the consumers in your feed based on categories
  - Clain one of the problem statments found on the feed to work on
  - Post survey questions for market research
> As a consumer account holder you can:
  - Post problem statements you find in everyday life and earn coins for every 'claimed' problem
  - Answer surveys found on the feed, posted by budding entrepreneurs to help with their market research and earn coins
> As an investor account holder you can:
  - Find interesting business pitch posts on the feed and contact the entrepreneur directly if interested

Note: This is a prototype of the mobile app created based on an original idea for academic purpose.
